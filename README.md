DESCRIPTION: Made in collaboration with Mikko Raussi and Onni Kytönummi during the Tite GameJam (Small scale GameJam organized by our school seniors) in the spring of 2016.

The theme of the GameJam was "Journey". After the mandatory jokes about remaking the TGC game Journey (Serously, I think every single team made at least one jab at it) we decided to make a zombie survival game about gathering supplies to be able to traverse to the next level. The theme isn't the most creative, but mostly we wanted to challenge ourselves with the mechanical design rather than storylines.

ABOUT LEVELS: We might have made a mistake with the levels and a lack of focus. We decided to make three levels to make a point about the importance of the collected gear, but two of them are underdeveloped. The first level is a debugging are that Raussi refined to a proper level, which we put as the first one due to it's size and simplicity. Unfortunately, as I've said in the Sidescoller notes, his levels tend to be on the harder side; there's barely enough supplies and the level is so open and empty that it's easy to get lost. The second level was made by Kytönummi, as I and Raussi had both made one already, but unfortunately due to lack of time there isn't much polish, and due to layering issues and asset spreading there are some invisible walls and other errors. However, I'm quite proud of the third level. It is vast but roughly segmented, so it's simpler to navigate. There's a lot of variety to the found equipment, even one secret and probably the most supplies. It might be a lot to ask, but please try to play through the entire game, the levels are very different from eachother.
